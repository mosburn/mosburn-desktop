This package has not been used for some time, it is being kep as an artifact of how to make a metapackage for debian based systems only.

I have since reverted to using puppet and/or ansible to bootstrap my systems based on personal and/or buisness setups.

Any further work on this is just to allow me to get any future CI development to happen with examples in case I need it in the future.
